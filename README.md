App::cpanminus - get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN

This repository contains two distributions:

- App-cpanminus: fatpacked cpanm frontend
- Menlo: backend modules and libraries

The repository is shared because a monorepo makes it easier to keep the history and releases in sync, as well as to share GitHub issues and PRs.
